        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello! I'm <strong>REYMOND SERVINO</strong>, a passionate and dedicated web developer with a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end technologies. My journey in programming started when I was in senior high school, and since then, I've been constantly evolving to build innovative and user-friendly digital solutions.</p>

        <p>With experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Java, I'm proficient in crafting visually appealing, responsive websites. I enjoy working on creating seamless user experiences, whether it's a dynamic web application or a static website.</p>

        <p>I also have some experience with frameworks like Vue.js and Node.js, along with a solid understanding of RESTful APIs and version control systems like Git.</p>

        <p>I'm passionate about learning new technologies and improving my coding practices. Whether it's adopting new design trends, experimenting with UI/UX principles, or diving into backend development, I’m always ready to take on new challenges.</p>

        <p>Outside of coding, I have a love for problem-solving, listening to music, and reading. I believe in the power of continuous learning and strive to grow both professionally and personally. I’m always looking to collaborate on exciting projects that challenge me to push my boundaries.</p>

        <p>Feel free to check out my projects and connect with me if you’re interested in working together or just want to chat about tech!</p>
